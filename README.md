# CS410 Final Project
This is the final project of CS410 introduction to web development course. The project is to bulid a personal website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I mostly referenced the textbook and our lecture notes, and bootstrap. Most CSS job in this project use bootstrap to accomplish. This personal website is a one page website with different sections. In the final part there's a form that is used to practice JavaScript that I use it to fetch data with event handler, and output the data retrieved to console.
## How to run
`index.html` is the main page and the only page.
`styles.css` is the styling sheet, but most of styling is done using bootstrap.
`index.js` is the JavaScript part that interact with the form element.
### Outside source
Bootstrap v5.2<br />
Color theme picked from this website https://paletton.com/.
